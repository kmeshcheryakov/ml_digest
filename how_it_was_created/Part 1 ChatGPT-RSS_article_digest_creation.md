#### You:
I have a list of RSS feeds. I want to collect all the articles for today and yesterday with a short description. I want to use Python. These articles will later be sent to a Language model to provide me with a personal digest

#### ChatGPT:
To collect articles from a list of RSS feeds for today and yesterday using Python, you can use libraries like `feedparser` to parse the RSS feeds and `dateutil` to handle dates. Here's a script that demonstrates how to achieve this:

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install feedparser python-dateutil
```

2. Create a Python script:

```python
import feedparser
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil import parser

# List of RSS feed URLs
rss_feeds = [
    'https://example.com/feed1.rss',
    'https://example.com/feed2.rss',
    # Add more RSS feed URLs here
]

# Function to filter articles published today and yesterday
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    article_date = parser.parse(entry.published)
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)

# Function to extract required information from an article entry
def extract_article_info(entry):
    return {
        'title': entry.title,
        'link': entry.link,
        'published': entry.published,
        'description': entry.summary,
    }

# Collect and filter articles
recent_articles = []

for rss_feed in rss_feeds:
    feed = feedparser.parse(rss_feed)
    
    for entry in feed.entries:
        if filter_recent_articles(entry):
            article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
            recent_articles.append(article_info)

# Print the recent articles
for article in recent_articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print(f"Published: {article['published']}")
    print(f"Description: {article['description']}\n")
```

Replace the example URLs in the `rss_feeds` list with the URLs of the RSS feeds you want to collect articles from. This script will parse each RSS feed, filter out articles published today and yesterday, and print their title, link, published date, and description. You can later send this data to a language model for further processing.


#### You:
The feed list in the OPML format containted in an xml file

#### ChatGPT:
In that case, you'll need to parse the OPML file to extract the RSS feed URLs first. You can use the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module from Python's standard library for this. Here's a modified version of the previous script that reads RSS feed URLs from an OPML file:

1. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install feedparser python-dateutil
```

2. Create a Python script:

```python
import feedparser
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil import parser

# OPML file containing the list of RSS feeds
opml_file = 'feeds.opml'

# Function to parse OPML and return a list of RSS feed URLs
def parse_opml(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    rss_feeds = []
    
    for outline in root.iter('outline'):
        xml_url = outline.get('xmlUrl')
        if xml_url:
            rss_feeds.append(xml_url)
    
    return rss_feeds

# Function to filter articles published today and yesterday
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    article_date = parser.parse(entry.published)
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)

# Function to extract required information from an article entry
def extract_article_info(entry):
    return {
        'title': entry.title,
        'link': entry.link,
        'published': entry.published,
        'description': entry.summary,
    }

# Parse the OPML file and collect RSS feeds
rss_feeds = parse_opml(opml_file)

# Collect and filter articles
recent_articles = []

for rss_feed in rss_feeds:
    feed = feedparser.parse(rss_feed)
    
    for entry in feed.entries:
        if filter_recent_articles(entry):
            article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
            recent_articles.append(article_info)

# Print the recent articles
for article in recent_articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print(f"Published: {article['published']}")
    print(f"Description: {article['description']}\n")
```

Replace `'feeds.opml'` with the path to your OPML file containing the RSS feed URLs. This script will read the OPML file, parse it to get the list of RSS feed URLs, and then collect and filter the articles as before.


#### You:
  File "/home/keyran/Docs/RnD/ml_digest/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/feedparser/util.py", line 158, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError("object has no attribute '%s'" % key)
AttributeError: object has no attribute 'published'


#### ChatGPT:
Apologies for the confusion. It seems that the 'published' attribute is not available for some articles. In such cases, we can use the 'updated' attribute as a fallback. Here's the modified script with this change:

```python
import feedparser
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil import parser

# OPML file containing the list of RSS feeds
opml_file = 'feeds.opml'

# Function to parse OPML and return a list of RSS feed URLs
def parse_opml(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    rss_feeds = []
    
    for outline in root.iter('outline'):
        xml_url = outline.get('xmlUrl')
        if xml_url:
            rss_feeds.append(xml_url)
    
    return rss_feeds

# Function to filter articles published today and yesterday
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    article_date = parser.parse(entry.get('published', entry.get('updated')))
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)

# Function to extract required information from an article entry
def extract_article_info(entry):
    return {
        'title': entry.title,
        'link': entry.link,
        'published': entry.get('published', entry.get('updated')),
        'description': entry.summary,
    }

# Parse the OPML file and collect RSS feeds
rss_feeds = parse_opml(opml_file)

# Collect and filter articles
recent_articles = []

for rss_feed in rss_feeds:
    feed = feedparser.parse(rss_feed)
    
    for entry in feed.entries:
        if filter_recent_articles(entry):
            article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
            recent_articles.append(article_info)

# Print the recent articles
for article in recent_articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print(f"Published: {article['published']}")
    print(f"Description: {article['description']}\n")
```

This should fix the AttributeError by using the 'updated' attribute when 'published' is not available.


#### You:
can you make it work asynchronously?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! You can use `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries to fetch the RSS feeds asynchronously. First, you'll need to install `aiohttp`:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

Then, modify the script to use asynchronous functions:

```python
import asyncio
import feedparser
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil import parser

# OPML file containing the list of RSS feeds
opml_file = 'feeds.opml'

# Function to parse OPML and return a list of RSS feed URLs
def parse_opml(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    rss_feeds = []
    
    for outline in root.iter('outline'):
        xml_url = outline.get('xmlUrl')
        if xml_url:
            rss_feeds.append(xml_url)
    
    return rss_feeds

# Function to filter articles published today and yesterday
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    article_date = parser.parse(entry.get('published', entry.get('updated')))
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)

# Function to extract required information from an article entry
def extract_article_info(entry):
    return {
        'title': entry.title,
        'link': entry.link,
        'published': entry.get('published', entry.get('updated')),
        'description': entry.summary,
    }

# Asynchronous function to fetch an RSS feed
async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed):
    async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
        content = await response.text()
        feed = feedparser.parse(content)
        return feed

# Asynchronous function to collect and filter articles from multiple feeds
async def fetch_recent_articles(rss_feeds):
    recent_articles = []
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_feed(session, rss_feed) for rss_feed in rss_feeds]
        feeds = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        for feed in feeds:
            for entry in feed.entries:
                if filter_recent_articles(entry):
                    article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
                    recent_articles.append(article_info)
    
    return recent_articles

# Parse the OPML file and collect RSS feeds
rss_feeds = parse_opml(opml_file)

# Run the asynchronous functions and print the recent articles
recent_articles = asyncio.run(fetch_recent_articles(rss_feeds))

for article in recent_articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print(f"Published: {article['published']}")
    print(f"Description: {article['description']}\n")
```

This script uses `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to fetch the RSS feeds concurrently, which can speed up the execution when dealing with multiple feeds.

TypeError: Parser must be a string or character stream, not NoneType

#### ChatGPT:
My apologies for the oversight. The issue arises because some entries do not have either 'published' or 'updated' attributes, resulting in a `None` value being passed to the `parser.parse()` function.

To fix this issue, you can update the `filter_recent_articles()` function to handle cases where both 'published' and 'updated' attributes are missing. One approach is to return `False` if both attributes are not available, thereby skipping such entries.

Here's the updated `filter_recent_articles()` function:

```python
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    published = entry.get('published')
    updated = entry.get('updated')

    if not (published or updated):
        return False

    article_date = parser.parse(published or updated)
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)
```

With this change, the script should no longer throw a TypeError when encountering entries without 'published' and 'updated' attributes.


#### You:
How to show progress of the process?

#### ChatGPT:
You can use the `tqdm` library to display progress bars for the tasks in your script. First, install the `tqdm` library:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

Then, modify the script to include progress bars for the asynchronous tasks:

```python
import asyncio
import feedparser
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil import parser
from tqdm import tqdm

# OPML file containing the list of RSS feeds
opml_file = 'feeds.opml'

# Function to parse OPML and return a list of RSS feed URLs
def parse_opml(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    rss_feeds = []
    
    for outline in root.iter('outline'):
        xml_url = outline.get('xmlUrl')
        if xml_url:
            rss_feeds.append(xml_url)
    
    return rss_feeds

# Function to filter articles published today and yesterday
def filter_recent_articles(entry):
    published = entry.get('published')
    updated = entry.get('updated')

    if not (published or updated):
        return False

    article_date = parser.parse(published or updated)
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    return article_date.date() in (today, yesterday)

# Function to extract required information from an article entry
def extract_article_info(entry):
    return {
        'title': entry.title,
        'link': entry.link,
        'published': entry.get('published', entry.get('updated')),
        'description': entry.summary,
    }

# Asynchronous function to fetch an RSS feed
async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar):
    async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
        content = await response.text()
        feed = feedparser.parse(content)
        progress_bar.update(1)
        return feed

# Asynchronous function to collect and filter articles from multiple feeds
async def fetch_recent_articles(rss_feeds):
    recent_articles = []
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        with tqdm(total=len(rss_feeds), desc="Fetching feeds") as pbar:
            tasks = [fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, pbar) for rss_feed in rss_feeds]
            feeds = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

            for feed in feeds:
                for entry in feed.entries:
                    if filter_recent_articles(entry):
                        article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
                        recent_articles.append(article_info)
    
    return recent_articles

# Parse the OPML file and collect RSS feeds
rss_feeds = parse_opml(opml_file)

# Run the asynchronous functions and print the recent articles
recent_articles = asyncio.run(fetch_recent_articles(rss_feeds))

for article in recent_articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print(f"Published: {article['published']}")
    print(f"Description: {article['description']}\n")
```

The progress bar will be displayed while fetching the RSS feeds, showing the number of completed tasks and the total tasks.


#### You:
There are encoding problems with some feeds  so that the text looks like п©п╟п╨п╣я┌п╫п╬пЁп╬ я└п╦п╩я▄я┌я─п╟ nftables 1.0.7, я┐п╫п╦я 

#### ChatGPT:
The encoding issue might be due to the fact that the response content is not being interpreted with the correct encoding by the `aiohttp` library. To address this, you can use the `response.charset` attribute to decode the content with the correct encoding.

Modify the `fetch_feed` function to decode the content using the correct charset:

```python
async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar):
    async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
        content = await response.read()
        charset = response.charset if response.charset else 'utf-8'
        decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
        feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content)
        progress_bar.update(1)
        return feed
```

By using the `response.charset` attribute, you ensure that the content is decoded using the correct encoding provided by the server. If no charset is provided, it will default to 'utf-8'. Additionally, the `errors='ignore'` argument will ignore any decoding errors that might occur, allowing the script to continue running.


#### You:
Now the text is empty for these feeds

#### ChatGPT:
My apologies for the inconvenience. If the text is empty for some feeds, it could be because the `response.charset` attribute is not detecting the correct encoding or it's missing. Let's try another approach to automatically detect the encoding using the `chardet` library.

First, install the `chardet` library:

```bash
pip install chardet
```

Now, modify the `fetch_feed` function to use `chardet` for detecting the encoding:

```python
import chardet

async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar):
    async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
        content = await response.read()
        detected_encoding = chardet.detect(content)
        charset = detected_encoding['encoding'] if detected_encoding['encoding'] else 'utf-8'
        decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
        feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content)
        progress_bar.update(1)
        return feed
```

This will use the `chardet` library to automatically detect the encoding of the content, and if it can't detect the encoding, it will default to 'utf-8'. This should provide better results in handling various encodings across different feeds.


#### You:
I have this exception some times 
aiohttp.client_exceptions.ServerDisconnectedError: Server disconnected

#### ChatGPT:
This exception occurs when the server unexpectedly closes the connection. To handle such cases, you can implement a retry mechanism in the `fetch_feed` function. This will retry the request a certain number of times before giving up. Here's the updated `fetch_feed` function with a retry mechanism:

```python
import chardet

async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar, max_retries=3, delay_between_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
                content = await response.read()
                detected_encoding = chardet.detect(content)
                charset = detected_encoding['encoding'] if detected_encoding['encoding'] else 'utf-8'
                decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
                feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content)
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return feed
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(delay_between_retries)
            else:
                print(f"Error fetching feed '{rss_feed}': {str(e)}")
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return None
```

This function will now retry the request up to `max_retries` times with a delay of `delay_between_retries` seconds between each attempt. If the request still fails after all retries, it will print an error message and return `None`.

Make sure to update the `fetch_recent_articles` function to handle the case when `fetch_feed` returns `None`:

```python
async def fetch_recent_articles(rss_feeds):
    recent_articles = []
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        with tqdm(total=len(rss_feeds), desc="Fetching feeds") as pbar:
            tasks = [fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, pbar) for rss_feed in rss_feeds]
            feeds = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

            for feed in feeds:
                if feed is not None:
                    for entry in feed.entries:
                        if filter_recent_articles(entry):
                            article_info = extract_article_info(entry)
                            recent_articles.append(article_info)
    
    return recent_articles
```

This should make your script more resilient to server disconnections and other client errors.


#### You:
For some reason, this line 
                feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content)
reverts the decoding. I checked the decoded content, it has a correct encoding.

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the confusion. The `feedparser` library should be able to handle the encoding automatically. Since you've already used `chardet` to detect the encoding and decoded the content, you can pass the detected encoding to `feedparser` directly to avoid reverting the decoding.

Update the `fetch_feed` function to pass the detected encoding to `feedparser.parse()`:

```python
import chardet

async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar, max_retries=3, delay_between_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
                content = await response.read()
                detected_encoding = chardet.detect(content)
                charset = detected_encoding['encoding'] if detected_encoding['encoding'] else 'utf-8'
                decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
                feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content, response_headers={'content-type': f'application/xml; charset={charset}'})
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return feed
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(delay_between_retries)
            else:
                print(f"Error fetching feed '{rss_feed}': {str(e)}")
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return None
```

By providing the response headers with the correct `content-type` and encoding to `feedparser.parse()`, it should now preserve the correct encoding when parsing the feeds.


#### You:
But we have already decoded the string, why we pass the initial encoding, when we need to pass the new one? I think we need to pass UTF-8 there

#### ChatGPT:
You are correct. Since the content has already been decoded using the detected encoding, we should pass 'utf-8' as the charset for the `content-type` header. Here's the updated `fetch_feed` function with the correct charset:

```python
import chardet

async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar, max_retries=3, delay_between_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
                content = await response.read()
                detected_encoding = chardet.detect(content)
                charset = detected_encoding['encoding'] if detected_encoding['encoding'] else 'utf-8'
                decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
                feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content, response_headers={'content-type': 'application/xml; charset=utf-8'})
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return feed
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(delay_between_retries)
            else:
                print(f"Error fetching feed '{rss_feed}': {str(e)}")
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return None
```

By setting the charset to 'utf-8' in the `content-type` header, `feedparser` should now handle the decoded content correctly.


#### You:
Chardet incorrectly detects content in UTF-8

#### ChatGPT:
I understand that `chardet` might not always detect the encoding correctly, especially for UTF-8. In this case, let's try another approach using the `cchardet` library, which is a faster and more accurate alternative to `chardet`.

First, install the `cchardet` library:

```bash
pip install cchardet
```

Then, modify the `fetch_feed` function to use `cchardet` for detecting the encoding:

```python
import cchardet as chardet

async def fetch_feed(session, rss_feed, progress_bar, max_retries=3, delay_between_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            async with session.get(rss_feed) as response:
                content = await response.read()
                detected_encoding = chardet.detect(content)
                charset = detected_encoding['encoding'] if detected_encoding['encoding'] else 'utf-8'
                decoded_content = content.decode(charset, errors='ignore')
                feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content, response_headers={'content-type': 'application/xml; charset=utf-8'})
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return feed
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(delay_between_retries)
            else:
                print(f"Error fetching feed '{rss_feed}': {str(e)}")
                progress_bar.update(1)
                return None
```

The `cchardet` library should provide more accurate results when detecting encodings, including UTF-8.


#### You:
Ok, now everything seems to work correctly

I'm glad to hear that everything is working correctly now! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Good luck with your project!


#### You:
Ok, now I want to add integration with NLP agent. Here is the documentation:

Chat completions Beta
Using the OpenAI Chat API, you can build your own applications with gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 to do things like:

Draft an email or other piece of writing
Write Python code
Answer questions about a set of documents
Create conversational agents
Give your software a natural language interface
Tutor in a range of subjects
Translate languages
Simulate characters for video games and much more
This guide explains how to make an API call for chat-based language models and shares tips for getting good results. You can also experiment with the new chat format in the OpenAI Playground.

Introduction
Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output.

Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversations (such as those previously served by instruction following models like text-davinci-003).

An example API call looks as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
# Note: you need to be using OpenAI Python v0.27.0 for the code below to work
import openai

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)
The main input is the messages parameter. Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and content (the content of the message). Conversations can be as short as 1 message or fill many pages.

Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. In the example above, the assistant was instructed with "You are a helpful assistant."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not always pay strong attention to system messages. Future models will be trained to pay stronger attention to system messages.
The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.

The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.

Including the conversation history helps when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user’s final question of "Where was it played?" only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the World Series of 2020. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied via the conversation. If a conversation cannot fit within the model’s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.

Response format
An example API response looks as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
{
 'id': 'chatcmpl-6p9XYPYSTTRi0xEviKjjilqrWU2Ve',
 'object': 'chat.completion',
 'created': 1677649420,
 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 56, 'completion_tokens': 31, 'total_tokens': 87},
 'choices': [
   {
    'message': {
      'role': 'assistant',
      'content': 'The 2020 World Series was played in Arlington, Texas at the Globe Life Field, which was the new home stadium for the Texas Rangers.'},
    'finish_reason': 'stop',
    'index': 0
   }
  ]
}
In Python, the assistant’s reply can be extracted with response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].

Every response will include a finish_reason. The possible values for finish_reason are:

stop: API returned complete model output
length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit
content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters
null: API response still in progress or incomplete
Managing tokens
Language models read text in chunks called tokens. In English, a token can be as short as one character or as long as one word (e.g., a or apple), and in some languages tokens can be even shorter than one character or even longer than one word.

For example, the string "ChatGPT is great!" is encoded into six tokens: ["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"].

The total number of tokens in an API call affects:

How much your API call costs, as you pay per token
How long your API call takes, as writing more tokens takes more time
Whether your API call works at all, as total tokens must be below the model’s maximum limit (4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo-0301)
Both input and output tokens count toward these quantities. For example, if your API call used 10 tokens in the message input and you received 20 tokens in the message output, you would be billed for 30 tokens.

To see how many tokens are used by an API call, check the usage field in the API response (e.g., response['usage']['total_tokens']).

Chat models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 use tokens in the same way as other models, but because of their message-based formatting, it's more difficult to count how many tokens will be used by a conversation.

DEEP DIVE
Counting tokens for chat API calls
To see how many tokens are in a text string without making an API call, use OpenAI’s tiktoken Python library. Example code can be found in the OpenAI Cookbook’s guide on how to count tokens with tiktoken.

Each message passed to the API consumes the number of tokens in the content, role, and other fields, plus a few extra for behind-the-scenes formatting. This may change slightly in the future.

If a conversation has too many tokens to fit within a model’s maximum limit (e.g., more than 4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo), you will have to truncate, omit, or otherwise shrink your text until it fits. Beware that if a message is removed from the messages input, the model will lose all knowledge of it.

Note too that very long conversations are more likely to receive incomplete replies. For example, a gpt-3.5-turbo conversation that is 4090 tokens long will have its reply cut off after just 6 tokens.

Instructing chat models
Best practices for instructing models may change from model version to version. The advice that follows applies to gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and may not apply to future models.

Many conversations begin with a system message to gently instruct the assistant. For example, here is one of the system messages used for ChatGPT:

You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Answer as concisely as possible. Knowledge cutoff: {knowledge_cutoff} Current date: {current_date}

In general, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not pay strong attention to the system message, and therefore important instructions are often better placed in a user message.

If the model isn’t generating the output you want, feel free to iterate and experiment with potential improvements. You can try approaches like:

Make your instruction more explicit
Specify the format you want the answer in
Ask the model to think step by step or debate pros and cons before settling on an answer
For more prompt engineering ideas, read the OpenAI Cookbook guide on techniques to improve reliability.

Beyond the system message, the temperature and max tokens are two of many options developers have to influence the output of the chat models. For temperature, higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. In the case of max tokens, if you want to limit a response to a certain length, max tokens can be set to an arbitrary number. This may cause issues for example if you set the max tokens value to 5 since the output will be cut-off and the result will not make sense to users.

Chat vs Completions
Because gpt-3.5-turbo performs at a similar capability to text-davinci-003 but at 10% the price per token, we recommend gpt-3.5-turbo for most use cases.

For many developers, the transition is as simple as rewriting and retesting a prompt.

For example, if you translated English to French with the following completions prompt:

Translate the following English text to French: "{text}"
An equivalent chat conversation could look like:

1
2
3
4
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."},
  {"role": "user", "content": 'Translate the following English text to French: "{text}"'}
]
Or even just the user message:

1
2
3
[
  {"role": "user", "content": 'Translate the following English text to French: "{text}"'}
]
FAQ

As of March 1st, 2023, we retain your API data for 30 days but no longer use your data sent via the API to improve our models. Learn more in our data usage policy.

Adding a moderation layer
If you want to add a moderation layer to the outputs of the Chat API, you can follow our moderation guide to prevent content that violates OpenAI’s usage policies from being shown.

#### ChatGPT:
To integrate the OpenAI Chat API into your Python script, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have installed the OpenAI Python library (v0.27.0 or later).

```
pip install openai
```

2. Set up your API key. You can find your API key in the OpenAI website's API key section.

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
```

3. Create a function that takes the articles as input and returns a summarized digest using the Chat API.

```python
async def generate_digest(articles):
    conversation = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the following articles concisely:"},
    ]

    for article in articles:
        conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": f"Title: {article['title']}.\nDescription: {article['description']}."})

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=conversation,
    )

    summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    return summary
```

4. Call the `generate_digest` function with the articles you've collected using the RSS feed parser.

```python
articles = collect_articles(xml_file_path)

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
digest = loop.run_until_complete(generate_digest(articles))
print(digest)
```

This code will generate a summarized digest of the articles you've collected. Note that you may need to modify the `generate_digest` function according to your specific requirements or to handle more complex interactions with the Chat API.


#### You:
Provide me with collect_articles function that uses RSS and functions we created before


#### ChatGPT:
Here's the `collect_articles` function that uses the previously created functions along with RSS feed parsing:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import feedparser
from typing import List

async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def fetch_all(urls: List[str]):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        for url in urls:
            tasks.append(fetch(session, url))
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

def collect_articles(feed_urls: List[str]):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    xmls = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_all(feed_urls))

    articles = []
    for xml in xmls:
        decoded_content = decode_content(xml)
        feed = feedparser.parse(decoded_content)
        articles.extend([{'title': entry.title, 'description': entry.description} for entry in feed.entries if filter_recent_articles(entry)])

    return articles

# Example usage:
feed_urls = [
    'https://news.ycombinator.com/rss',
    'https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml'
]

articles = collect_articles(feed_urls)
print(articles)
```

This `collect_articles` function takes a list of feed URLs, fetches their content asynchronously using the `fetch_all` function, decodes the content, and then parses each feed using `feedparser`. It collects articles that pass the `filter_recent_articles` filter and returns a list of articles with titles and descriptions.
